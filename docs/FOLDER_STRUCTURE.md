# Folder Structure

- `src/` - Main application source code (React components, hooks, utils)
- `src-tauri/` - Tauri backend and config
- `public/` - Static assets
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `tests/` - Test files and fixtures
- `dist/` - Production build output

Follow conventions for naming and organization. New features go in `src/` as components or modules.
