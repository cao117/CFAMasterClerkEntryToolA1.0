# CFA Cat Show: Championship Finals Process

## Overview
In a CFA (Cat Fanciers' Association) cat show, cats compete in different classes based on age and registration status. The three main classes are:

- **Championship**: Adult cats (8 months or older)
- **Premiership**: (Not covered here)
- **Kittens**: (Not covered here)

This document focuses on the **Championship Finals** process.

## Championship Cat Classes
Championship cats (adults) are divided into three classes:

- **Grand Champion (GC)**: Cats that have achieved the highest title by accumulating points after becoming a Champion.
- **Champion (CH)**: Cats that have met the criteria to become a Champion.
- **Novice (NOV)**: Cats not registered with CFA; they cannot obtain Champion or Grand Champion titles.

**Short notations:**
- Grand Champion: `GC`
- Champion: `CH`
- Novice: `NOV`

## Hair Length Divisions
All championship cats are further classified as either:
- **Longhair (LH)**
- **Shorthair (SH)**

## Finals Structure
There are two major levels of competition in the championship class:

### 1. Top 10/15 Championship Final (Ring-Type Dependent)
- **The top 10/15 championship final is not always allbreed; it depends on the ring type:**
  - **Allbreed Ring:** Top 10 or 15 best championship cats (GC, CH, NOV) regardless of hair length classification.
  - **Longhair (LH) Ring:** Top 10 or 15 best LH championship cats (GC, CH, NOV).
  - **Shorthair (SH) Ring:** Top 10 or 15 best SH championship cats (GC, CH, NOV).
- In all cases, "championship cats" means all adult cats: GC, CH, and NOV.
- It is possible for any of these (GC, CH, NOV) to win a position in the top 10/15 championship final for their ring type.
- The number of positions (10 or 15) depends on the total number of championship cats entered in that ring.

### 2. Champion-Only Finals (Subcategory of Championship)
These are restricted to **Champion (CH)** cats only (GC and NOV are not eligible):
- **Best Allbreed Champion (Best AB CH):** The best Champions, regardless of LH/SH classification (only in allbreed rings).
- **Best Longhair Champion (Best LH CH):** The best Champion cats that are Longhair (in allbreed and LH rings).
- **Best Shorthair Champion (Best SH CH):** The best Champion cats that are Shorthair (in allbreed and SH rings).

#### Key Rules:
- Every Best AB CH cat must also appear as either a Best LH CH or Best SH CH (never both).
- **The union of all cats in Best LH CH and Best SH CH is not required to match Best AB CH.**
- **Only the subset of cats in Best LH CH and Best SH CH that are also in Best AB CH must, together, match all Best AB CH cats, with no duplicates or omissions and in order.**
- The remaining positions in LH/SH CH are filled with other eligible Champion cats (fillers), and these fillers always come after all Best AB CH cats for that section.
- The order of cats in Best LH CH and Best SH CH must preserve the order from Best AB CH.
- Fillers (cats not in Best AB CH) may only appear after all Best AB CH cats are placed, if more positions are available than Best AB CH cats.
- It is not possible for a Best AB CH cat to be 2nd or 3rd in either specialty final; by definition, Best AB CH is the best cat regardless of hair length.

## Number of Awards
- If the number of championship cats in a ring is **85 or more**:
  - Top 15 championship final is awarded.
  - 5 Best AB CH, 5 Best LH CH, and 5 Best SH CH are awarded (as appropriate for the ring type).
- If fewer than 85 championship cats:
  - Top 10 championship final is awarded.
  - 3 Best AB CH, 3 Best LH CH, and 3 Best SH CH are awarded (as appropriate for the ring type).

### Specialty Rings
- In a Longhair or Shorthair specialty ring, only the respective LH/SH championship cats (GC, CH, NOV) are judged for the top 10/15 championship final.
- Only Best LH CH or Best SH CH awards are given (no AB CH or opposite specialty awards in specialty rings).
- If the number of LH/SH championship cats is less than 85, only top 10 and 3 Best LH/SH CH are awarded.

## Notation Summary
- **GC**: Grand Champion
- **CH**: Champion
- **NOV**: Novice
- **LH**: Longhair
- **SH**: Shorthair

## Notes
- Only CH cats are eligible for Champion-only finals (Best AB CH, Best LH CH, Best SH CH).
- GC and NOV cats are not eligible for these awards.
- All rules above are enforced in the CFA Master Clerk Entry Tool for validation and test data generation.
- **Championship cats** always refers to all adult cats (GC, CH, NOV); **Champion cats** refers only to CH, a subcategory of championship cats, and have their own level of competition.
