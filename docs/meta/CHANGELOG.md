# Project Changelog

This changelog records major changes to the CFA Master Clerk Entry Tool, including validation rule changes, documentation restructuring, and feature additions.

## Validation Rule Change Log

### [2024-06-09] Allbreed Best CH â†’ LH/SH Split (Test Data Generation)
- **Area:** ChampionshipTab.tsx (test data generation)
- **Change:** Updated logic to split Best CH cats into LH/SH using the odd/even rule (odd = LH, even = SH) for test data population. All Best CH cats are now assigned to either LH or SH, and only fillers are used if there are more positions than cats.
- **Rationale:** Ensures test data always matches intended validation logic and passes validation. Prevents missing Best CH cats in LH/SH split and aligns with user requirements.

### [2024-06-09] Validation Info Box Removed
- **Area:** ChampionshipTab.tsx (UI)
- **Change:** Removed the static 'Validation Rules' info box from the Championship tab UI. Users now rely solely on inline error messages for guidance.
- **Rationale:** Reduces UI clutter and encourages users to use error messages for understanding validation failures.

### [2024-06-09] Documentation Restructuring
- **Area:** docs/
- **Change:** Grouped all markdown documentation into subfolders: validation, guides, specs, meta. Recreated missing validation markdowns and changelog.
- **Rationale:** Improves organization, maintainability, and clarity of project documentation.
