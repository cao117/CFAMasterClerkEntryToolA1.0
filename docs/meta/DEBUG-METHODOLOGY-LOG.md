## [2024-12-19 15:30:00] DEBUGGING SESSION: Show Count Input Backspace Deletion Inconsistency
- **Bug Type**: Runtime behavior inconsistency
- **Approach**: Context 7 + Chain of Thought analysis (2 runtime fix attempts)
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Context 7 MCP for comprehensive codebase analysis
  - Chain of Thought reasoning for systematic hypothesis formation
  - User testing for verification at each step
- **Success Factors**: 
  - Systematic one-by-one questioning to avoid assumptions
  - Code evidence-based analysis instead of guessing
  - Incremental fixes with user testing between attempts
  - Clear identification of two separate root causes
- **Resolution**: Successfully fixed without requiring debug info insertion
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/GeneralTab.tsx` (update functions and blur handler)
- **User Confirmation**: "fixed" - complete resolution achieved
