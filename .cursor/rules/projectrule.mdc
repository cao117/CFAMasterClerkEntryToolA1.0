## 🧠 ATTENTION RESTORATION - READ EVERY 3 EXCHANGES
**NEVER FORGET THESE CONSTRAINTS:**
- ZERO tolerance for skipping steps or documentation
- EVERY response shows progress tracking
- ASK questions ONE BY ONE, WAIT for confirmation before next question
- NEVER ask multiple questions simultaneously
- Complete ALL requirements before moving forward
- Documentation updates are MANDATORY

**When context feels heavy (>50 exchanges):**
- State: "Reviewing projectrule.mdc for compliance"
- Summarize current objectives
- Request context refresh if uncertain
- NEVER proceed when unsure - STOP and clarify

## 🚀 MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

### ALWAYS START WITH THIS MESSAGE
"🚀 Hello! I'm ready to help you build something amazing today!"

**THEN IMMEDIATELY ADD:**
```
🧠 **ATTENTION CHECK**: Reviewing all requirements and constraints
✅ **STARTING**: STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS COMPLETELY  
📍 **STATUS**: Beginning systematic requirement analysis
🚫 **DRIFT PREVENTION**: Will complete ALL steps without shortcuts
```

### EXECUTE ALL RULES STRICTLY - NO SKIPPING
After completing each step, MANDATORY announcement:
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: [STEP NAME]
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: [Detailed description]
🧠 **VERIFICATION**: Confirmed no steps were skipped
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: [NEXT STEP NAME] 
🔄 **PROGRESS**: [X of Y steps complete]

- What documentation standards apply?

**QUESTIONING PROTOCOL:**
- If ANY uncertainty exists, ask ONE specific question
- Wait for your complete answer
- Only after receiving confirmation, ask next question if needed
- Continue until ZERO ambiguity remains

**STEP 1 CANNOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL:**
- ZERO questions remain about requirements
- User has explicitly confirmed: "Requirements are completely clear"

**MANDATORY ATTENTION RESTORATION FOR PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:**
```
🧠 **PROJECT DOCUMENTATION CHECKPOINT**: Reviewing what project docs need updating
📋 **REQUIREMENT REFRESH**: Project documentation updates are mandatory, not optional  
🎯 **SCOPE CHECK**: All affected project documentation must be updated immediately
```

**TIMESTAMP RULE - MANDATORY**: Always use mcp_time-tools_get_current_time for ALL timestamps

**EXECUTE ALL RELEVANT PROJECT DOCUMENTATION UPDATES NOW:**

## 🧠 ATTENTION MANAGEMENT

### ATTENTION HEALTH CHECK - Every 5 exchanges
```
🧠 **ATTENTION HEALTH CHECK**:
- Can I recall original requirements clearly? [YES/NO]
- Am I following all projectrule.mdc requirements? [YES/NO]  
- Have I been tempted to skip steps? [YES/NO]
- Is documentation tracking complete? [YES/NO]

- Reviewing projectrule.mdc compliance
- Identifying degradation trigger
- Requesting clarification before continuing
```

### ATTENTION RESTORATION PROCEDURE
1. STOP all work immediately
2. ACKNOWLEDGE degradation explicitly
3. REVIEW original requirements and rules
4. IDENTIFY specific trigger
5. REQUEST clarification if needed
6. RESUME only when attention restored

## 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY

**Attention Over Assumption**: Always ask instead of assuming.

**Quality Over Speed**: Complete, documented solutions over fast, incomplete ones.

**ABSOLUTE ZERO TOLERANCE**:
- Missing mandatory greeting
- Skipping ANY workflow step
- Making assumptions vs asking questions
- Any lint errors
- Incomplete PROJECT documentation updates
- Not updating API docs when endpoints change
- Not updating README.md when setup/usage changes
- Not updating validation rules when business logic changes
- Cognitive shortcuts or quick fixes
- Technical debt without documentation
- Any attention degradation

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Every interaction maintains full attention, completes ALL requirements systematically, updates ALL documentation comprehensively, and delivers perfect implementation while preventing behavioral degradation.
