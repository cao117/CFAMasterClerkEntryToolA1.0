# Debugging Rules - Manual Testing with Debug Information Workflow

---
alwaysApply: false
---

## 🧠 DEBUGGING ATTENTION MANAGEMENT - READ EVERY 3 EXCHANGES
**NEVER FORGET THESE DEBUGGING CONSTRAINTS:**
- ZERO tolerance for skipping debugging steps
- ASK clarifying questions ONE BY ONE, WAIT for confirmation before next question
- NEVER ask multiple questions simultaneously about the bug
- Manual testing with debug info after 2 failed fixes
- Complete ALL verification steps before implementing fixes
- Documentation updates are MANDATORY after confirmed fixes

**When debugging context feels heavy (>50 exchanges):**
- State: "Reviewing debugging-rules.mdc for compliance"
- Summarize current debugging progress and fix attempts
- Request context refresh if uncertain about bug details
- NEVER proceed with fixes when unsure - STOP and clarify

### ALWAYS EXECUTE ALL RULE STRICTLY WITHOUT SKIPPING
**REQUIRED**: Always apply all the rules below strictly one by one, do not skip or alter the rules in anyway. After a step is done, always let user know which next rule is being completed. AGAIN THIS IS MANDATORY

## MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

### ALWAYS START WITH THIS MESSAGE
**REQUIRED**: Every debugging response must begin with:
"🔍 Ready to solve this puzzle! Let me analyze this issue systematically and understand exactly what's happening."

**THEN IMMEDIATELY ADD STEP TRACKING:**
```
🧠 **DEBUGGING ATTENTION CHECK**: Reviewing bug details carefully
✅ **STARTING**: STEP 1 - INITIAL BUG UNDERSTANDING
📍 **STATUS**: Beginning systematic analysis without assumptions
🚫 **ASSUMPTION PREVENTION**: Will ask questions instead of assuming bug details
```

## 📝 MANDATORY STEP COMPLETION ANNOUNCEMENTS
**After completing EVERY step, ALWAYS announce:**

```
✅ **COMPLETED**: [STEP NAME] 
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: [Brief description of what was accomplished]
🧠 **VERIFICATION**: Confirmed no debugging steps were skipped
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: [NEXT STEP NAME]
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: [X of Y steps complete]
🔧 **FIX ATTEMPTS**: [X attempts made] (track throughout session)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 🚨 LINT ERROR EXCEPTION PROTOCOL

### LINT ERROR DETECTION AND HANDLING
**When the reported issue is a lint error:**
- **IMMEDIATE IDENTIFICATION**: Recognize lint errors vs runtime bugs
- **BYPASS MANUAL TESTING**: Lint errors don't require user testing
- **UNLIMITED FIX ATTEMPTS**: Lint error fixes don't count toward 2-fix limit
- **DIRECT RESOLUTION**: Fix all lint errors immediately without debug info

**LINT ERROR INDICATORS:**
- ESLint errors/warnings
- TypeScript compiler errors
- Prettier formatting issues
- Import/export errors
- Unused variable warnings
- Code style violations
- Missing type annotations

### LINT ERROR WORKFLOW
```
🔍 **LINT ERROR DETECTED**

**Issue Type**: Lint/Compiler Error (Not Runtime Bug)
**Error Details**: [Specific lint error description]
**Files Affected**: [List of files with lint issues]

**FIXING IMMEDIATELY** - No manual testing needed
**Fix attempts for lint issues do NOT count toward the 2-fix limit**
```

**LINT ERROR FIX PROCESS:**
1. **Identify all related lint errors** in the codebase
2. **Fix systematically** following project standards
3. **Verify compliance** with linting rules
4. **Continue fixing** until all lint errors resolved
5. **No user testing required** for lint-only issues

**AFTER LINT FIXES:**
```
✅ **LINT ERRORS RESOLVED**
📍 **WHAT WAS FIXED**: [List of lint issues resolved]
🔧 **LINT FIX ATTEMPTS**: [X] attempts (Do not count toward runtime fix limit)
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: [Continue with original workflow or await confirmation]
```

### STEP 1: INITIAL BUG UNDERSTANDING (NO ASSUMPTIONS - ENHANCED QUESTIONING)
**When user reports a bug:**
- Listen carefully to the user's description of the issue
- Analyze the expected behavior vs actual behavior described
- Use existing knowledge to understand the problem area
- Form initial hypothesis based on user description alone

**ENHANCED QUESTIONING PROTOCOL:**
- If ANY detail is unclear, ask ONE specific question
- WAIT for user's complete answer
- Only after receiving confirmation, ask next question if needed
- Continue until ZERO ambiguity about the bug remains

**Present Initial Understanding:**
```
Based on your description, here's my understanding:

**Issue Location**: [Specific page/component/feature based on description]
**Expected Result**: [What should happen according to user]
**Actual Result**: [What actually happens according to user]
**My Initial Analysis**: [Hypothesis of what might be wrong]

I need to confirm this understanding before proceeding.

FIRST QUESTION: Is this understanding of the issue location correct?
[Wait for answer before asking about expected behavior]
```

**QUESTIONING SEQUENCE (One by One):**
1. First ask about issue location accuracy
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Then ask about expected behavior accuracy  
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Then ask about actual behavior accuracy
6. Wait for confirmation
7. Finally ask about any missing details
8. Wait for confirmation

**Only proceed when user confirms ALL aspects are correct**

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 1 - INITIAL BUG UNDERSTANDING
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: Analyzed description, asked clarifying questions one by one
🧠 **ANTI-ASSUMPTION**: Confirmed complete understanding without making assumptions
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: Proceeding to STEP 2 - CONTEXT 7 DEEP ANALYSIS
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 1 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **FIX ATTEMPTS**: 0 attempts made
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 2: CONTEXT 7 DEEP ANALYSIS (AFTER CONFIRMATION)
**Once understanding is CONFIRMED:**

#### 2.1 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE ANALYSIS
**MANDATORY** Context 7 MCP investigation:
- Use Context 7 MCP to analyze entire codebase related to the issue
- Map all files, components, and functions involved in the reported behavior
- Understand complete data flow from user action to final result
- Identify all dependencies, integrations, and architectural patterns
- Study existing similar functionality that works correctly

#### 2.2 IMPLEMENTATION DEEP DIVE
```
REQUIRED Analysis Documentation:
- **Entry Points**: Where does the problematic flow begin?
- **Execution Path**: What functions/components are called in sequence?
- **Data Transformations**: How is data processed through the flow?
- **External Dependencies**: What APIs, libraries, or services are involved?
- **Potential Failure Points**: Where could the implementation be failing?
```

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 2 - CONTEXT 7 DEEP ANALYSIS
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: Comprehensive codebase analysis using Context 7 MCP
🧠 **SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS**: Mapped complete data flow and dependencies
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: Proceeding to STEP 3 - CHAIN OF THOUGHT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 2 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **FIX ATTEMPTS**: 0 attempts made
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 3: CHAIN OF THOUGHT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
**MANDATORY** systematic reasoning process:

#### 3.1 HYPOTHESIS FORMATION FROM CODE ANALYSIS
```
**Primary Hypothesis**: [Most likely cause based on code analysis]
**Code Evidence**: [Specific implementation details that support this]
**Logic Flow**: [How the bug manifests through the code path]

**Alternative Hypotheses**:
- Hypothesis 2: [Second most likely cause with code evidence]
- Hypothesis 3: [Third possibility with supporting analysis]

**Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low] - Based on code analysis certainty
```

#### 3.2 SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION PROCESS
```
For each hypothesis, analyze:
- **Implementation Logic**: Does the code logic support this theory?
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Are data transformations correct?
- **Error Handling**: Are edge cases properly handled?
- **Async/Timing Issues**: Are there potential race conditions?
- **Integration Points**: Are external dependencies working as expected?
```

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 3 - CHAIN OF THOUGHT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: Systematic hypothesis formation and elimination process
🧠 **METHODICAL REASONING**: Tested multiple hypotheses against code evidence
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: Proceeding to STEP 4 - FIRST FIX ATTEMPT
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 3 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **FIX ATTEMPTS**: 0 attempts made - Ready for first attempt
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 4: FIRST FIX ATTEMPT (BASED ON ANALYSIS)
**Implement fix based on Context 7 + Chain of Thought analysis:**

#### 4.1 CHECK FOR LINT ERROR EXCEPTION
**BEFORE implementing runtime fix:**
```
🔍 **ISSUE TYPE VERIFICATION**:
- Is this a lint/compiler error? [YES = Skip to lint fix protocol]
- Is this a runtime behavior issue? [YES = Continue with manual testing workflow]

If LINT ERROR: Apply Lint Error Exception Protocol (unlimited fixes, no user testing)
If RUNTIME BUG: Continue with standard fix attempt protocol below
```

#### 4.2 IMPLEMENT PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS FIX (Runtime Bugs Only)
- Address the most likely cause identified in analysis
- Follow all coding standards and project patterns  
- Include comments explaining the fix rationale
- Make minimal changes that target the specific issue

#### 4.3 PRESENT FIX FOR TESTING (Runtime Bugs Only)
```
🔧 **RUNTIME FIX ATTEMPT 1 IMPLEMENTED**

**Root Cause Targeted**: [Primary hypothesis from analysis]
**Solution Applied**: [Specific changes made]
**Files Modified**: [List of files changed]
**Rationale**: [Why this fix should resolve the issue]

**TESTING REQUEST**:
Please test the original issue now:
1. [Specific steps to reproduce the original issue]
2. Check if the issue is resolved
3. Verify no new issues appeared

Reply with "FIXED" if resolved, or describe what still happens.
```

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 4 - FIRST FIX ATTEMPT
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: [Implemented lint fixes] OR [Implemented runtime fix for testing]
🧠 **TARGETED APPROACH**: Applied minimal fix based on systematic analysis
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: [Continue with Step 5 if runtime] OR [Lint fixes complete]
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 4 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **RUNTIME FIX ATTEMPTS**: [0 for lint, 1 for runtime] - [Awaiting test results for runtime]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 5: SECOND FIX ATTEMPT (IF FIRST RUNTIME FIX FAILED)
**Only execute if user reports first RUNTIME fix didn't work:**

#### 5.1 VERIFY NOT A LINT ERROR
**BEFORE second runtime fix attempt:**
```
🔍 **ISSUE TYPE RE-VERIFICATION**:
- Did user report lint/compiler errors in testing? [YES = Switch to lint protocol]
- Is this still a runtime behavior issue? [YES = Continue with second runtime fix]

If NEW LINT ERRORS appeared: Apply Lint Error Exception Protocol
If STILL RUNTIME BUG: Continue with second runtime fix attempt below
```

#### 5.2 ANALYZE FIRST RUNTIME FIX FAILURE
- Review why primary hypothesis was incorrect
- Move to secondary hypothesis from chain of thought analysis
- Consider any new information from user's test results

#### 5.3 IMPLEMENT SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS FIX (Runtime Only)
```
🔧 **RUNTIME FIX ATTEMPT 2 IMPLEMENTED**

**First Fix Analysis**: [Why first attempt didn't work]
**New Root Cause Targeted**: [Secondary hypothesis]  
**Solution Applied**: [Different approach implemented]
**Files Modified**: [List of files changed]
**Rationale**: [Why this approach should work]

**TESTING REQUEST**:
Please test the issue again:
1. [Same reproduction steps]
2. Check if issue is now resolved
3. Report any remaining problems (including any lint errors)

Reply with "FIXED" if resolved, or describe current behavior.
```

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 5 - SECOND FIX ATTEMPT
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: [Implemented lint fixes] OR [Implemented second runtime fix for testing]
🧠 **ADAPTIVE APPROACH**: Learned from first attempt and adjusted strategy
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: [Continue fixing lint] OR [Awaiting test results before STEP 6 (Debug Info)]
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 5 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **RUNTIME FIX ATTEMPTS**: [X] runtime attempts - If this fails, will add debug info
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 6: DEBUG INFO INSERTION (AFTER 2 FAILED RUNTIME FIXES)
**Only execute if both previous RUNTIME fixes failed:**

#### 6.1 VERIFY RUNTIME BUG (NOT LINT ERRORS)
**BEFORE adding debug info:**
```
🔍 **FINAL ISSUE TYPE VERIFICATION**:
- Has user reported lint/compiler errors during testing? [YES = Fix lint issues first]
- Is this confirmed as a runtime behavior issue? [YES = Add debug info]
- Have 2 runtime fix attempts been made? [YES = Proceed with debug info]

If LINT ERRORS present: Apply Lint Error Exception Protocol first
If RUNTIME BUG confirmed: Continue with debug info insertion below
```

#### 6.2 ADD COMPREHENSIVE DEBUG INFO (Runtime Bugs Only)
```
🐛 **ENTERING DEBUG INFO MODE FOR RUNTIME BUG**

After 2 RUNTIME fix attempts, I need runtime debugging information.
I'm adding comprehensive debug messages to capture what's actually happening.

**Debug Info Strategy**:
- Console logs at key execution points
- Variable value tracking through the problematic flow
- Error state monitoring
- Timing and async operation logging  
- User interaction event tracking

**Files Being Instrumented**: [List of files getting debug info]
```

#### 6.2 IMPLEMENT DEBUG LOGGING
**Add strategic console.log statements:**
- Entry points to problematic functions
- Variable states before/after transformations
- Conditional branch tracking
- API request/response logging
- Error boundary information
- User interaction event details

#### 6.3 DEBUG TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
```
🔍 **DEBUG TESTING PROTOCOL**

I've added debug information throughout the code. Here's what I need:

**STEP-BY-STEP TESTING**:
1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Clear the console
3. Reproduce the issue following these exact steps:
   [Detailed step-by-step instructions]
4. Copy ALL console messages (including errors, warnings, logs)
5. Paste the complete console output in your response

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Don't filter the console output - copy everything
- Include any error messages in red
- Include all debug logs I added
- If nothing appears in console, tell me "NO CONSOLE OUTPUT"

This debug info will show me exactly what's happening at runtime.
```

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 6 - DEBUG INFO INSERTION
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: Added comprehensive debug logging for runtime bug analysis
🧠 **RUNTIME INVESTIGATION**: Prepared to analyze actual execution behavior
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: Waiting for user to provide console debug output
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 6 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **RUNTIME FIX ATTEMPTS**: 2 runtime attempts made - Now gathering runtime data
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 7: DEBUG INFO ANALYSIS AND FIX (ITERATIVE)
**Execute when user provides console output:**

#### 7.1 ANALYZE CONSOLE OUTPUT
```
🔍 **DEBUG OUTPUT ANALYSIS**

**Console Data Received**: [Acknowledge receipt]
**Key Findings**:
- Execution path traced: [What actually happened]
- Variable states observed: [Actual vs expected values]
- Error conditions detected: [Any errors or warnings]
- Timing issues identified: [Async operation analysis]
- Unexpected behaviors: [Deviations from expected flow]

**ROOT CAUSE UPDATED**: [New understanding based on runtime data]
```

#### 7.2 IMPLEMENT DEBUG-INFORMED FIX
```
🔧 **DEBUG-INFORMED FIX IMPLEMENTED**

**Runtime Evidence Shows**: [What console output revealed]
**Actual Problem**: [Real issue based on debug data]
**Solution Applied**: [Fix targeting the real problem]
**Debug Logs Updated**: [Modified debug messages for next iteration]

**TESTING REQUEST**:
Please test again with console open:
1. Clear console
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Copy any new console output
4. Report if issue is resolved

Reply with "FIXED" if working, or paste new console output.
```

#### 7.3 ITERATIVE DEBUG LOOP
**Continue this pattern until fixed:**
- If still not working: Add more targeted debug info
- Update debug messages based on new findings
- Request another console output cycle
- Implement next fix based on accumulated debug data
- Repeat until user confirms "FIXED"

**THEN ANNOUNCE:**
```
✅ **COMPLETED**: STEP 7 - DEBUG INFO ANALYSIS AND FIX (ITERATION X)
📍 **WHAT WAS DONE**: Analyzed runtime data and implemented evidence-based fix
🧠 **EVIDENCE-BASED**: Used actual execution data to target real problem
⏭️ **NEXT STEP**: Awaiting test results (continue iteration or proceed to STEP 8)
🔄 **DEBUG PROGRESS**: 7 of 8 debugging steps complete
🔧 **RUNTIME FIX ATTEMPTS**: [Initial 2] + [Debug iterations] = [Total runtime attempts]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### STEP 8: MANDATORY CLEANUP AND DOCUMENTATION (AFTER FIX CONFIRMED)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 🧠 DEBUGGING ATTENTION MANAGEMENT

### DEBUGGING SESSION HEALTH CHECK - Every 5 exchanges
```
🧠 **DEBUGGING ATTENTION HEALTH CHECK**:
- Can I recall the original bug description clearly? [YES/NO]
- Am I tracking fix attempts correctly? [YES/NO]  
- Should I be adding debug info instead of more fixes? [YES/NO]
- Is my analysis based on evidence vs assumptions? [YES/NO]
- Do I need to refresh debugging context? [YES/NO]

If ANY answer is NO: REQUEST DEBUGGING CONTEXT REFRESH
```

### DEBUG INFO DECISION LOGIC
```
🔄 **DEBUG INFO TRIGGER CONDITIONS**:
- After 2 failed fix attempts
- When static analysis confidence is low
- When user reports unexpected behavior not matching analysis
- When fix attempts seem to miss the real issue
- When runtime behavior is needed to understand the problem
```

### ANTI-SHORTCUT DEBUGGING ENFORCEMENT
Before ANY debugging decision, ask:
- "Have I already tried 2 fixes without success?"
- "Should I be adding debug info instead of another fix attempt?"
- "Am I assuming something about runtime behavior I should verify?"
- "Will debug info give me better evidence than more static analysis?"

If uncertain about ANY answer:
- STOP immediately
- Assess current fix attempt count
- Consider if debug info approach is needed
- Only proceed with clear justification

## DEBUGGING WORKFLOW SUMMARY

### FIX ATTEMPT STRATEGY
1. **Runtime Attempts 1-2**: Use Context 7 + Chain of Thought analysis (manual testing required)
2. **Lint Error Fixes**: Unlimited attempts, no manual testing, don't count toward runtime limit
3. **After 2 runtime failures**: Switch to debug info + runtime analysis approach
4. **Continue debug iterations**: Until user confirms "FIXED"
5. **Always distinguish**: Lint errors vs runtime bugs throughout process

### MANUAL TESTING INTEGRATION
- **User tests every fix attempt**
- **Console output provides runtime evidence**
- **Debug info reveals actual execution behavior**
- **Iterative improvement based on real data**
- **No automated testing assumptions**

## DEBUGGING SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Perfect Manual Testing Debugging Achieved When**:
- Issue understanding confirmed through systematic one-by-one questioning
- Maximum 2 fix attempts based on static analysis before adding debug info
- Runtime debugging approach used when static analysis insufficient
- Debug info provides actual execution evidence vs assumptions
- User confirms resolution through systematic manual testing
- **ALL 7 documentation files created/updated with complete details**

**ABSOLUTE ZERO TOLERANCE**:
- More than 2 RUNTIME fix attempts without debug info
- Counting lint error fixes toward the 2-fix runtime limit
- Requesting manual testing for lint/compiler errors
- Implementing fixes without user testing confirmation (except lint errors)
- Assuming runtime behavior without debug evidence
- Making assumptions instead of asking clarifying questions one by one
- Asking multiple questions simultaneously instead of systematically
- Any form of debugging attention degradation or cognitive shortcuts
- Skipping debug info approach after 2 failed runtime analysis fixes
- **SKIPPING ANY STEP 8 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**
- **Missing documentation updates after confirmed fixes**
- **Not using mcp_time-tools_get_current_time for timestamps**
- **Incomplete documentation verification checklist**
